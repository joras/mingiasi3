### test task:

1. Create a trial account in Pipedrive and add 10-20 contacts
2. Create a trial account in Mailchimp, create a list, and add 10-20 contacts (some of them different from Pipedrive)
3. Create a service with REST API endpoint which returns:
    1. List of contacts in Mailchimp list which are not in Pipedrive
    2. List of contacts in Pipedrive which are not in Mailchimp list
4. Bonus
    1. Think about the extensibility, how can we support other CRMs besides Pipedrive (Capsule, for example) and other marketing tools besides Mailchimp (GetResponse, for example)
